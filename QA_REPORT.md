# Sand Dunes Stage QA Report

## Summary
- **Build**: Phaser sand dunes prototype `v0.2.0`
- **Environment**: macOS (developer), Phaser 3.70, Matter.js
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for further polishing

## Test Matrix
| Suite | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Unit | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ Validates traction loss, friction acceleration, gravity/bounce bounds |
| Integration | `npm run test:integration` | ✅ Confirms dune profile, vehicle spec, and checkpoints |
| End-to-End | `npm run test:e2e` | ⏳ Skipped – Playwright script pending interactive hooks |

## Key Checks
- Traction blends slope (>35°) and speed penalties without falling below 60%.
- Vehicle mass/torque configuration ensures spawn stability.
- Three checkpoints defined with bilingual labels, enabling save logic later.
- Camera zoom and offset adapt to slope/velocity to avoid jitter.

## Observations / Follow-up
- Add deterministic seed override for dune generation before recording final footage.
- Replace procedural audio with mastered assets and expose volume controls in Settings UI.
- Finalize Playwright flow once UI automation IDs are in place.
